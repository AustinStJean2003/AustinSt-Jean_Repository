<h1>Fastest Sport on Wheels</h1>
<p>Founded in 1994, the first race of the IndyCar series was the Indy 200 on Jan. 27, 1996, at Walt Disney World Speedway in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. (It was won by Buzz Calkins).</p>

<p>The drivers drive single-seat, open-cockpit cars that feature a 2.2-liter, twin turbocharged, direct-injected V-6 engine optimized to run at 12,000 RPM with an estimated 500-700 horsepower depending on the turbocharger boost setting. The consumer-relevant engines, which are supplied by Chevrolet and Honda, utilize E85 fuel.</p>
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>The IndyCar Series races faster and closer than any other form of motorsports.</p>
<ul>
<li>96 races with a margin of victory less than one second.</li>
<li>The fastest race in IndyCar Series history was in 2003 at California Speedway with an average speed of 207.151 mph.</li>
<li>There have been eight races with a margin of less than one-tenth of a second between its 1-2-3 finishers.</li>
<li>Thirty-one tracks and 46 drivers have been involved in the 96 races with a margin of victory less than one second.</li>
</ul>
IndyCar Series cars reach speeds up to 235 mph at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Race-inspired developments that translate to commercial applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of the technologies made on the racetrack by Firestone, translate to the tires driven by consumers today.</li>
<li>Data gathered during crashes from the ear accelerometers worn by all drivers is shared with the commercial automotive industry through conferences and universities, which can lead to safety policy changes for auto manufacturers. NASA and the United States Air Force also use the data in developing helmets, seats and harnesses.</li>
<li>The direct-injected, twin turbocharged engine formula is comparable to the powerplants being utilized by automakers worldwide as they try to build more fuel efficient vehicles.</li>
<li>The first rear-view mirror was created for the Indianapolis 500. Other Indianapolis 500 firsts are the use of four-wheel hydraulic brakes in 1921, front-wheel drive in 1924 and all-wheel drive in 1932.</li>
