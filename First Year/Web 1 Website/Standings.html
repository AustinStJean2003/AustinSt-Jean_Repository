    <h2>Playoff Format</h2>
    <p>Throughtout the regular season, all eight teams play eachother at least once. All eight teams are sent to the playoffs. Car ball league works under a double elimination sytle tournament. The way a double elimination tournament works is there is two side to the bracket. One is the winners side, the other is the losers side. To be eliminated from this tournament you must be defeated twice. Therefore you can afford to face defeat once but two times your out. When a team loses their first series the are sent to the losers side of the braket where they will face other teams who have also lost their series. The winners od series advance in the winners brakets and face off against other series winners. Third place goes to the team who loses their series in the semi-finals of the losers braket. Second goes to the loser of the finals and of course the team who goes undefeated or onlu lose once are crowned champions. All series are best of 7.</p>

    <h2>Tie-Breaking Procedure</h2>
    <p>The team with the most points are at the top of the standings. In the case of teams having the same number of points by the end of the regular season, these procedures determine the teams positions in the following order</p>
    <p>1. The greater number of games won, excluding the games won in overtime. (Regulation wins)</p>
    <p>2. Points percentage. This is calculated by taking the number of games where a team earns points in a game divide by total number of games played multipled by 100. Higher number is the better team.</p>
    <p>3. Plus minus rating. This is calculated by subracting the goals for bu the goals against. Higher number is the better team.</p>
